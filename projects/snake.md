summary: "A browser-based recreation of the classic Snake game using JavaScript and the HTML canvas element."
---

This project is a recreation of the classic Snake game similar to the version popularized by Google’s browser game. It was built using plain JavaScript and the HTML canvas element to handle rendering, movement, and collision detection. The snake is represented as an array of coordinates that update continuously in a timed game loop, while keyboard input controls its direction.

Through this project, I practiced real-time rendering on a canvas, managing game state with arrays, detecting collisions with both walls and the snake’s own body, and generating random objects that must avoid existing game elements. Although simple in concept, this project helped me better understand how interactive browser applications work behind the scenes and how game logic can be implemented without any external libraries.
