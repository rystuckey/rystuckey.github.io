*Everyone has to start somewhere, and this is where it starts for me.*

Ever since I was a kid, I knew that an IT related field would be where I pursued a career.  As a kid, I knew that my interests were in technology and computers, and one day, I may be able to learn how to program things myself, and use these tools to my advantage.

It started with just playing video games then, but now, I am pursuing a career where I use computers in my everyday life.  This interest in computers has led me to pursue a computer science degree and learn the skills necessary to work in this field.

## My Interests

As a kid I mainly used computers for video games, but growing up I realized there are many more uses for computers, and many jobs would be available for those uses.  Now, I am interested in mainly software engineering as a main career path, but also exploring cybersecurity and AI fields as well.

Through my studies at UH, I have learned various skills that define the core of computer science, ranging from programming principles to the data structures and algorithms behind computers.  

## Languages and Projects

At the University of Hawaii, at the time of writing I have taken 2 years of computer science classes and completed the lower division of computer science classes.  Through those classes I have learned Java, Python, C, and C++ and created console application projects that reflect those skills.

On my own time, I have worked on projects to learn the basics of front-end development, specifically learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.  I have also worked with technologies such as TailwindCSS and Bootstrap for styles.  Furthermore, this class is teaching me the fundamentals of Typescript as well.

## Looking Forward

I am unsure where my skills will take me in my career, but I will always strive to improve my skills in these fields and learn as much as I can.
